## WRF-CMAQ Tutorial ## 

### Procedure to build the WRF-CMAQ model using gnu compiler: ###

### Step 1: choose your compiler, and load it using the module command if it is available on your system

```
module avail
```

```
module load openmpi_4.0.1/gcc_9.1.0 
```

### Step 2: Download and install netCDF Fortran and C libraries

   **Skip to Step 3, if you have a module for netCDF avialable on your system and you have loaded it**

   Follow the tutorial for building libraries to build netCDF C and Fortran Libraries
   https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/blob/main/DOCS/Users_Guide/Tutorials/CMAQ_UG_tutorial_build_library_gcc.md
   
   - Follow these instructions to combine the libraries into a single combined directory
   
   ```
   cd /[your_install_path]/LIBRARIES
   mkdir netcdf_combined
   cp -rp ./netcdf-fortran-4.4.5-gcc9.1.0/* ./netcdf_combined/
   cp -rp ./netcdf-c-4.7.0-gcc9.1.0/* ./netcdf_combined/
   ```
   
   Now you should have a copy of both the netcdf C and netcdf Fortran libraries under 
   netcdf_combined/lib

   - set the following environment variables including the path to your combined netcdf libraries, include files
   
   ```
   setenv NETCDF [your_install_path]/LIBRARIES/netcdf_combined
   setenv CC gcc
   setenv CXX g++
   setenv FC gfortran
   setenv FCFLAGS -m64
   setenv F77 gfortran
   setenv FFLAGS -m64
   ```
   
 - check to see that the path to each compiler is defined using
 
    ```
    which gcc
    which g++
    which gfortran
    ```
    
  - If they are not found, ask for assistance from your system administrator, 
    or if you know the path then specify it using the environment variable
    
    ```
    setenv CC /nas/longleaf/apps/gcc/9.1.0/bin/gcc
    ```

### Edit your .cshrc to add the path to the library by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

```
#for gcc WRF-CMAQ build
setenv NCF_COMBO /[your_install_path]/LIBRARIES/netcdf_combined/
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${NCF_COMBO}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```

### Make sure that there is no other definition or setting of LD_LIBRARY_PATH further down in your .cshrc file that may be overwriting your setting.

### Make sure you log out and log back, or run csh in to activate the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting.

### Step 3: Download IOAPI_3.2 (a specific tagged version, see below) and install it.

Note The complete I/O API installation guide can be found at either of the following:

https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/documentation/all_versions/html/AVAIL.html

or

https://cjcoats.github.io/ioapi/AVAIL.html

#### Follow the instructions on how to install I/O API available

#### Method 1. Download the tar.gz file from the github site.

     cd /[your_install_path]/LIBRARIES     
     wget http://github.com/cjcoats/ioapi-3.2/archive/20200828.tar.gz
     tar -xzvf 20200828.tar.gz
     cd ioapi-3.2-20200828
     

#### Method 2. Use Git clone to obtain the code
    
     cd /[your_install_path]/LIBRARIES 
     git clone https://github.com/cjcoats/ioapi-3.2
     cd ioapi-3.2         ! change directory to ioapi-3.2
     git checkout -b 20200828   ! change branch to 20200828 for code updates
     cd ..                      ! change directories to the level above ioapi-3.2
     ln -s ioapi-3.2 ioapi-3.2-2020828 ! create a symbolic link to specify the tagged version
     cd ioapi-3.2                      ! change back to the directory
     

#### Change directories to the ioapi directory
     
     
     cd ioapi
     
     
#### Copy the Makefile.nocpl to Makefile 
     
     
     cp Makefile.nocpl Makefile

#### Change the BASEDIR definition from HOME to INSTALL

```
BASEDIR = ${HOME}/ioapi-3.2
````
change to
```
BASEDIR = ${INSTALL}/ioapi-3.2
```
     
     
 #### set the INSTALL and BIN environment variables:
     
     
     setenv INSTALL [your_install_path]/LIBRARIES
     setenv BIN  Linux2_x86_64gfort_openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0
     
     
 ### set the CPLMODE environment variable
 
     setenv CPLMODE nocpl
     

 #### Make the installation directory

    
     mkdir $INSTALL/$BIN

 ### Link the installation directory to the generic directory name supported by WRF-CMAQ 
 
     cd $INSTALL
     ln -s Linux2_x86_64gfort_openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0 Linux2_x86_64gfort
      
 ### Edit the Makefile to add a path to the combined netCDF library directory
 ### Note this is the Makefile at the ioapi-3.2 level. 
 ### First need to copy Makefile.template Makefile
 
 ```
 cp Makefile.template Makefile
 ```
 
 change
 
 ```
 NCFLIBS = -lnetcdff -lnetcdf
 ```
 
 to
 
   ```
   NCFLIBS    = -L $NETCDF/lib/ -lnetcdff -lnetcdf   ! using the combined $NETCDF environment variable set above
   ```
 
 #### change into the ioapi directory and copy the existing Makeinclude.Linux2_x86_64gfort to have an extension that is the same as the BIN environment variable
 
 ```
 cd ioapi
 cp Makeinclude.Linux2_x86_64gfort Makeinclude.Linux2_x86_64gfort_openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0
 ```
 ### Edit the Makeinclude.Linux2_x86_64gfort_openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0 to comment out the OMPFLAG and OMPLIB
 
 ```
 gedit Makeinclude.Linux2_x86_64gfort_openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0
 ```
 
 - comment out the following lines by adding a #
 
 ```
# OMPFLAGS  =  -fopenmp
# OMPLIBS   =  -fopenmp
 ```
 
 ### Create the Makefile in the m3tools directory
 
 ```
 cd ../m3tools
 cp Makefile.nocpl Makefile
 ```
 
 
 ### Build ioapi using one of the following commands
 
 ```
 cd ioapi 
 make HOME='[your_install_path]/LIBRARIES' |& tee make.log ! method if you did not modify HOME variable in Makefile
 or
 make |& tee make.log     ! method if you did replace HOME variable with INSTALL
 ```
 
 ### Verify that the libioapi.a and the m3tools have been successfully built
 
 ```
 ls -lrt $INSTALL/ioapi-3.2-20200828/Linux2_x86_64gfort_openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0/libioapi.a
 ```
 
 ### Note: If you get a shared object problem when trying to run m3tools such as the following:
 ```
./juldate
./juldate: error while loading shared libraries: libimf.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
### Be sure that the appropriate module is loaded, or that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains a path to the shared opject file that is missing.
```
module load openmpi_4.0.1/gcc_9.1.0
```

 ### Note: If you need to rebuild the I/O API library to remove the dependency on OpenMP use
 ```
 cd ioapi
 make HOME='[your_install_path]/LIBRARIES' clean ! if you have not modified the Makefile
 or 
 make clean ! if you have modified the Makefile to use the INSTALL environment variable and set it at the command line
 ```

### Step 4: Install CMAQ
  - Follow these instructions to download the code, then use the modifications in Step 5:  [CMAQ Benchmark Tutorial](CMAQ_UG_tutorial_benchmark.md)
In the directory where you would like to install CMAQ, create the directory issue the following command to clone the EPA GitHub repository for CMAQv5.3.3:

```
git clone -b main https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git CMAQ_REPO
```

Build and run in a user-specified directory outside of the repository

In the top level of CMAQ_REPO, the bldit_project.csh script will automatically replicate the CMAQ folder structure and copy every build and run script out of the repository so that you may modify them freely without version control.

Edit bldit_project.csh, to modify the variable $CMAQ_HOME to identify the folder that you would like to install the CMAQ package under. For example:

```
set CMAQ_HOME = [[your_install_path]]/WRF-CMAQ/CMAQ_v5.3.3
```

Now execute the script.

./bldit_project.csh

Change directories to the CMAQ_HOME directory

### Step 5. Edit and source the config_cmaq.csh to specify the paths of the ioapi and netCDF libraries 
### Go to the case [compiler] entry
### for example, if running using the gcc compiler, go to line 148, or search for 'case gcc'
   
```
#> I/O API and netCDF for WRF-CMAQ 
setenv NETCDF netcdf_root_gcc # Note please combine netCDF-C & Fortran Libraries (e.g. /usr/local/netcdf-4.7.0)
setenv IOAPI  ioapi_root_gcc  (e.g. /usr/local/ioapi-3.2)
setenv WRF_ARCH 34              # [1-75]  64 Bit Linux_x86 Compiler/Architecture options

 #> I/O API, netCDF, and MPI include and library locations
 setenv IOAPI_INCL_DIR   $IOAPI/ioapi/fixed_src   #> I/O API include header files
 setenv IOAPI_LIB_DIR    $IOAPI/Linux2_x86_64gfort_openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0   #> I/O API libraries
 setenv NETCDF_LIB_DIR   $NETCDF/lib  #> netCDF C directory path
 setenv NETCDF_INCL_DIR  $NETCDF/include  #> netCDF C directory path
 setenv NETCDFF_LIB_DIR  $NETCDF/lib #> netCDF Fortran directory path
 setenv NETCDFF_INCL_DIR $NETCDF/include #> netCDF Fortran directory path
 setenv MPI_LIB_DIR      mpi_lib_gcc
 
#> MPI directory path

```

Enter selection [1-75] : ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

####  If you have never configured WRF before, here are some guidelines

   - choose the dmpar option with the appropriate compiler platform (34 for gcc case)
   - For more information refer to the [WRF User Guide](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide_v4/v4.0/contents.html)

```
source config_cmaq.csh gcc
```

### Step 6: Modify the bldit_cctm.csh 

Uncomment the option to build WRF-CMAQ twoway:     

```
cd CCTM/scripts
```

edit bldit_cctm.csh
      
```
#> Two-way WRF-CMAQ 
set build_twoway                      #> uncomment to build WRF-CMAQ twoway; 
```


### Run the bldit_cctm.csh script
```
./bldit_cctm.csh gcc |& tee bldit_cctm_twoway.log
```

### At this point, Users who have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on their system should look for the following message at the end of their bldit_cctm_twoway.log: 

```
--->                  Executables successfully built                  <---

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 user home 51139232 Jun  7 19:03 main/ndown.exe

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 user home 81349320 Jun  7 19:02 main/wrf.exe

==========================================================================

```

  If the User sees this, the WRF-CMAQ model has been successfully compiled and built and they may skip to Step 12. If not, the User should double check the library paths above and try again. If it still fails, please reach post on the [CMAS Forum](https://forum.cmascenter.org/c/wrf-cmaq).


Note: Steps 7-10 are **ONLY** for systems without [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Step 7: Download WRF 4.3 and install it
   - Please register at the WRF User site https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_source.html
   - obtain the WRF-Modeling System source code
   - download version 4.3 from https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/releases/tag/v4.3
   - extract the tar.gz file
   
   ```
   cd [your_install_path]/WRF-CMAQ/CMAQ_v5.3.3/scripts
   tar -xzvf WRF-4.3.tar.gz ./BLD_WRFv4.3_CCTM_v533_gcc
   ```
   
### Step 8: Move wrfcmaq_twoway_coupler and BLD_CCTM_v533_gcc into BLD_WRFv4.3_CCTM_v533_gcc

```
source ../../config_cmaq.csh
mv BLD_CCTM_v533_gcc BLD_WRFv4.3_CCTM_v533_gcc/cmaq
cd BLD_WRFv4.3_CCTM_v533_gcc
cp -rp $CMAQ_REPO/UTIL/wrfcmaq_twoway_coupler .
```

### Step 9: Set environmnetal variable and run the coupler script

   ```
    setenv wrf_path $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts/BLD_WRFv4.3_CCTM_v532_gcc
   ./wrfcmaq_twoway_coupler/assemble
   ```
   
  - This command will update all necessary files in WRF and CMAQ to create the WRF-CMAQ model. 
  - Verify that the path for the I/O API library is set correctly in the configure.wrf file and modify if needed.
    
 ```
    #### BEGIN for WRF-CMAQ twoway model
IOAPI   = /proj/ie/proj/CMAS/WRFv4.3-CMAQv5.3.3_rel_debug/LIBRARIES/openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0/ioapi-3.2-20200820
LIOAPI  = Linux2_x86_64gfort_openmpi_4.0.1_gcc_9.1.0
    #### END for WRF-CMAQ twoway model
 ```

### Step 10: Configure and Compile the WRF-CMAQ model

```
setenv WRF_CMAQ 1
./configure 
./compile em_real >& mylog
```

####  If you have never configured WRF before, here are some guidelines

   - choose the dmpar option with the appropriate compiler platform (34 for gcc case)
   - For more information refer to the [WRF User Guide](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide_v4/v4.0/contents.html)


  - If compilation is done successfully, you can find main/wrf.exe file.

```
--->                  Executables successfully built                  <---

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 user home 51139232 Jun  7 19:03 main/ndown.exe
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 user home 51187088 Jun  7 19:03 main/real.exe
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 user home 50445512 Jun  7 19:03 main/tc.exe
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 user home 81349320 Jun  7 19:02 main/wrf.exe

==========================================================================

```
  - If not found, use vi or gedit to view the mylog file, and look for errors near the compilation step for wrf.exe

### Step 11: If you have to rebuild the model, but want to keep the configure.wrf file use:

```
./clean -a
```

### Step 12: Download the input data

[Link to CMAQv5.3.2_Benchmark_2Day_Input.tar.gz input data on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ex6Wr4dX6a0fgaDfhO0VEJNaCKqOflI5/view?usp=sharing)

  - Use the gdrive command to download the dataset.
  - If this is the first time that you are using gdrive, or if you have an issue with your token, please read the following instructions
  - [Tips to download data from CMAS Data Warehouse](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e7B94zFkbKygVWfrhGwEZL51jF4fGXGXZbvi6KzXYQ4)
  
  
  ```
  gdrive download 1ex6Wr4dX6a0fgaDfhO0VEJNaCKqOflI5
  ```
  
    
### Step 13: Run the WRF-CMAQ model

## Note, in this new coupled model design, the namelist is used to modify settings for WRF.
Environment variables such as WRF_CMAQ_FREQ are no longer used.  
The following commonly modified namelist options for WRF are specified in the run script.

    1. wrf_cmaq_option     (dictates how the coupled model execute)

       0 = run WRF only
       1 = run WRF only               w   producing MCIP like GRID and MET files
       2 = run WRF-CMAQ coupled model w/o producing MCIP like GRID and MET files
       3 = run WRF-CMAQ coupled model w   producing MCIP like GRID and MET files

    2. wrf_cmaq_freq       (indicate how often WRF and CMAQ interact)

    3. met_file_tstep      (time step size of MCIP like intermediate output files)

    4. direct_sw_feedback  (indicate to turn on aerosol short wave direct effect)

    5. feedback_restart    (indicate aerosol SW direct effect information is
                            available in the WRF restart file or not)
                            
* One sample run scripts is provided; run_cctm_Bench_2016_12SE1.WRFCMAQ.csh (for coupled
  model with SW feedback on.


  - Start with the run_cctm_Bench_2016_12SE1.WRFCMAQ.csh that specifies direct_sw_feedback = .true.
  - and the CMAQv5.3.3 input benchmark dataset to run CMAQ-WRF with feedback
  - It is configured to run on 16 processors and for 2 days of model simulation
  - Edit the script to specify the paths, modify the number of processors and batch queue commands
  - Verify that the OMIfile definition matches the latest release of CMAQv5.3.3
  
  Modify the following section to specify your local paths:
  
  ```
   set WORKDIR     = /proj/ie/proj/CMAS/WRF-CMAQ/CMAQ_v5.3.3/CCTM/scripts
     set WRF_DIR     = $WORKDIR/BLD_WRFv4.3_CCTM_v533_gcc  # WRF source code directory
     set INPDIR      = /proj/ie/proj/CMAS/WRF-CMAQ/from_EPA/from_gdrive/CMAQv5.3.2_Benchmark_2Day_Input/2016_12SE1
     set OMIpath     = $WRF_DIR/cmaq                              # path optics related data files
     set OUTPUT_ROOT = $WORKDIR  # output root directory
     set NMLpath     = $WRF_DIR/cmaq                              # path with *.nml file mechanism dependent
     set NMLpath2    = $WRF_DIR/cmaq                              # path with Species_Table_TR_0.nml file
     set EMISSCTRL   = $WRF_DIR/cmaq                              # path of Emissions Control Fil
  
  ```  
  
   - Verify the following settings
    ```
    set NPROCS =    16
    set OMIfile    = OMI_1979_to_2019.dat
    ```
    
  - Run the job (if you have a batch queuing system such as SLURM do:) 
  ```
  sbatch run_cctm_Bench_2016_12SE1.WRFCMAQ.csh
  ```
 
### Step 14: Verify that the run was successful
   - look for the output directory
   
   ```
   cd WRFCMAQ-output-sw_feedback
   ```
   If the run was successful you will see the following output
   
   ```
   tail ./2016183/rsl.out.0000
   ```
   |>---   PROGRAM COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY   ---<|

### Step 15: Compare results to the WRF-CMAQ 2 day benchmark results
 
   - Download WRF-CMAQ bencmark output data from the google drive folder

     https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ccNJ0GOH8cRCIfXN6dcFj0Dh-_hHXbo9

  - The WRF-CMAQ benchmark output is also available from the the US EPA anoymous ftp server:

     https://gaftp.epa.gov/exposure/CMAQ/V5_3_3/Benchmark/WRFv4.3-CMAQv5.3.3/

   - Compare CCTM_ACONC_4.3533_SE53BENCH_20160701.nc file, and other files to your benchmark results using the m3diff routine from I/O API Tools.

   - Note, the CMAQv5.3.3 output results will not directly compare to the no shortwave feedback (nosw) WRF-CMAQ output, as different meterology and timesteps were used.  To do a comparison between CMAQv5.3.3 and WRF-CMAQ, use WRF-CMAQ to output the MCIP meteorology files, and then use those MCIP inputs with the CMAQv5.3.3 ICON and BCON inputs.
