# 7. Model Output Files

In this section, details on the CCTM output files are provided. All CMAQ programs produce model output files that adhere to the netCDF format.  In addition to model data output, CMAQ can optionally produce ASCII log files that contain intermediate model execution information from the various CMAQ processes and captured with respect to processor number. If the log file option is not selected by the user and the simulation is run interactively, CMAQ will write all of the log information to the screen along with the standard error, which can be captured to a text file using basic UNIX syntax.

 *1. While "Hourly" is indicated, users may define a different time step (e.g. 30 minutes) for model output by changing the TSTEP variable in the runscript. From here onward, the term "Hourly" will be used for description purposes.    
 ** 2. X is the dimension along the x-axis, Y is the dimension along the y-axis, Z is the vertical dimension, Z' is the user pre-defined size of the vertical dimension (range from 1 to all layers) and W is a non layer dimension, e.g. number of LU fractions, number of sites for vertical extraction.    
 *** 3. A special ASCII output file, FLOOR_xxx with xxx being the processor number, contains information when a simulation results in negative concentrations. 

## 7.1 CCTM Output Files

Some output files created by the CCTM are considered standard output as these contain hourly concentration and deposition values and information to document the run.
<a id=cmaq_output_log></a>
### CMAQ output log
[Return to Table 7-1](#cmaq_output_log_t)

All of the CMAQ processors generate standard output and standard error during execution. When you run the CMAQ executable interactively, diagnostic output information can be captured to a log file using a UNIX redirect command:

```
run.cctm >& tee cctm.log
```


The LOGFILE environment variable allows users to specify the name of a log file for capturing the standard output from the program. If this variable is not set, the standard output is written to the terminal and can be captured using the UNIX redirect command (“>”), as shown in the example above.

<a id=conc></a>
### CTM_CONC_1: CCTM hourly instantaneous concentration file
[Return to Table 7-1](#conc_t)

The 3-D CCTM hourly concentration file (CONC) contains instantaneous gas-phase species mixing ratios (ppmV) and aerosol species concentrations (µg m<sup>-3</sup>) at the end of each model output time step. The number and types of species contained in the CONC files depend on the chemical mechanism and aerosol model configurations that are selected when the CCTM is compiled. The [FORTRAN NameLists](#matrix.nml) within the mechanism directories list the modeled species, and contain a column that specifies which species are written to the CONC files. The GC_*mechname*.nml file lists the gas-phase species, the AE_*mechname*.nml file lists the aerosol species, and the NR_*mechname*.nml lists the nonreactive (inert) species. Species can be removed from the CONC file by editing the CONC column in the NameList file(s) to reduce the number of species that are written to, and thus the size of the CONC file. User can also speify the output species list by modifying the environment variable CONC_SPCS.


<a id=aconc></a>
### A_CONC_1: CCTM hourly average concentration file
[Return to Table 7-1](#aconc_t)

The 3-D CCTM integral average concentration file (ACONC) contains average model species concentrations for each model hour, as opposed to instantaneous concentrations at the end of each output time step. The species written to the ACONC file are set by the user in the CCTM run script using the environment variable AVG_CONC_SPCS. The model layers that are used to calculate the integral average concentration are also set in the CCTM run script using the environment variable ACONC_BLEV_ELEV, where BLEV corresponds to the bottom layer number and ELEV corresponds to the top layer number. An example setting for the ACONC_BLEV_ELEV variable is “1 6”, which defines layers 1 through 6 as the vertical extent over which to calculate hourly average concentrations.

<a id=drydep></a>
### CTM_DRY_DEP_1: CCTM hourly cumulative dry deposition file
[Return to Table 7-1](#drydep_t)

The 2-D CCTM dry deposition file (DRYDEP) contains cumulative hourly dry deposition fluxes (kg hectare<sup>-1</sup>) for selected model species. CCTM calculates dry deposition for all of the species listed in the dry deposition column of the [FORTRAN NameLists](#matrix_nml) within the mechanism directories. The GC_*mechname*.nml file lists the gas-phase species, the AE_*mechname*.nml file lists the aerosol species, and the NR_*mechname*.nml lists the nonreactive (inert) species. Species can be removed from the dry deposition file by editing the DDEP column in the NameList file(s).

<a id=wetdep></a>
### CTM_WETDEP_1: CCTM hourly cumulative wet deposition file
[Return to Table 7-1](#wetdep_t)

The 2-D CCTM wet deposition file (WETDEP1) contains cumulative hourly wet deposition fluxes (kg hectare<sup>-1</sup>) for selected model species. CCTM calculates wet deposition for all of the species listed in the wet deposition column of the [FORTRAN NameLists](#matrix_nml) within the mechanism directories. The GC_*mechname*.nml file lists the gas-phase species, the AE_*mechname*.nml file lists the aerosol species, and the NR_*mechname*.nml lists the nonreactive (inert) species. Species can be removed from the wet deposition file by editing the WDEP column in the NameList file(s).

## 7.2 Restart Files

There are several files created by the CCTM that are used to enable a restart of the run for any specific day.  The files contain values for parameters at the end of the day which are used to initialize the values for the start of calculations for the next day.

<a id=cgrid></a>
### S_CGRID: CCTM restart file
[Return to Table 7-1](#cgrid_t)

The 3-D CCTM ending concentration file (CGRID) contains gas-phase species mixing ratios (ppmV) and aerosol species concentrations (µg m<sup>-3</sup>) at the end of each simulation period. The number and types of species contained in the output CGRID files depend on the chemical mechanism and aerosol model configurations that are selected when CCTM is compiled. This file can be used to initialize CCTM from a simulation period that the model completed. For example, if the CCTM is configure to produce daily output files, a CGRID file will be written out at the end of each simulation day. These concentrations then become the initial conditions for the next simulation period.

<a id=media></a>
### MEDIA_CONC: Bidirectional modeling media concentration file
[Return to Table 7-1](#media_t)

This 2-D CCTM file contains the soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and pH concentrations and/or the soil, vegetation and water Hg concentrations. This file is only created when the CTM_ABFLUX environment variable or the CTM_HGBIDI variable is set to Y (Default is N) and is used to initialize the next day of the model simulation.

<a id=soilout></a>
### SOILOUT

This optional 2-D CCTM file contains name and location of hourly soil NO emissions calculated in-line by the CCTM. This file is only created if the CTM_BIOGEMIS environment variable is set to Y (Default is N). 


## 7.3 Diagnostic and Advanced CMAQ Output Files

Along with the standard output files detailed in the previous section, CCTM can be configured to output several auxiliary files for diagnostic model purposes. Each option is controlled by its corresponding environment variable. For logical values, TRUE/T is equivalent to Y and FALSE/F is equivalent to N.

<a id=floor></a>
