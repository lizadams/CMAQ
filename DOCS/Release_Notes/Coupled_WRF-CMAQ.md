## Brief Description
The new coupled WRF-CMAQ model which is based on WRF 4.1.1 and CMAQ 5.3, is an online meteorology-chemistry model that simulates the two-way feedback between meteorology and chemistry. The feedback focuses on the interactions of estimated aerosol mass on incoming shortwave radiation.
