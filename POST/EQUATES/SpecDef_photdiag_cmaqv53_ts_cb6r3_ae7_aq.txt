! This Species Definition File is for Use with the COMBINE tool built for 
! post-processing CMAQ output. It is compatible with CMAQv5.2.
! Date: May 12 2017

! Output variables that begin with 'PM' represent those in which a size cut was 
! applied based on modeled aerosol mode parameters.  For example, PM25_NA is all 
! sodium that falls below 2.5 um diameter. These 'PM' variables are used for 
! comparisons at IMPROVE and CSN sites.

! Output variables that begin with 'PMAMS' represent the mass that would have
! been detected  by an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer.

! Output variables beginning with 'A' (aside from AIR_DENS) represent a 
! combination of aerosol species in which no size cut was applied.  For example, 
! ASO4IJ is the sum of i-mode and j-mode sulfate.  These 'A' variables are used 
! for comparisons at CASTNet sites.

! Output variables beginning with 'PMC' refer to the coarse fraction of total PM,
! computed by summing all modes and subtracting the PM2.5 fraction.  These 'PMC'
! variables are used for comparisons at SEARCH sites.

! This Species Definition File is just for use with the uncoupled, offline CMAQ,
! model. If you are processing WRF-CMAQ results, a different Species Definition
! file is required.
